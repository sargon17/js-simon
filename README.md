# Simon Says Game
### Boolean Creers home project
This is a simple memory game, you have 30 seconds to remember the displayed 5 numbers, and after input them in the same order.
The software will output if you win or lose and the amount of right numbers inputed.

Designed by me.

This is only a Desktop version.
